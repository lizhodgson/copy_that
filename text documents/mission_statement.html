            <p>Hey, what's wrong? Never mind. Let me guess. You are a writer and you're a little down because your while industry is in full disruption mode. I hear ya. Tough times. You've probably heard of elance.com. You may also have heard that it won't exactly lift your spirits, given the how much they seem to be paying writers there. Well cheer up. CopyThat is here and it's the cure to the writer's 21st century blues. And it's not just great for writers. It's great for clients too. Clients who want high quality copy that hasn't been copied and pasted from the interweb. It's good for everyone because despite all this disruption, the world still needs copy. Because, as they say in Hollywood, "if it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage." </p>
